# FARMSA-programming-for-finance-spring2021

This repository is meant to hold the slide deck along with the accompanying source code for the FARMSA Programming for Finance Spring 2021 Workshop that was presented during the FARMSA Stock Pitch Competition. Within this presentation, the idea of data analytics within finance was explored, along with the different software implementations (Excel, SQL, Python & libraries) that could be used in order to analyze, manipulate, and visualize financial data.
